# Project Title

Memory Game to run in a Web Browser.

## Getting Started

Open the "index.html" - file in a modern browser of your choice and start turning pairs of cards. If you have a match, you can just keep on turning pairs of cards until you got all of them revealed. If the current pair of cards doesn't match, the card borders are turned red and will turn themselves over after 2 seconds so that you can continue turning another pair of cards.

### Prerequisites

This game can be run on any modern web browser, capable of rendering html, css and running javascript.

### Installing

Unzip the folder and locate the index.html file within. Double-click this file and it will open in your default system's browser.
